"""
In this lab, we will achieve the following items:
    - Utilize the multiple variables routines developed in the previous lab
    - Run Gradient Descent on a data set with multiple features
    - Explore the impact of the learning rate alpha on gradient descent
    - Improve performance of gradient descent by feature scaling using z-score normalization

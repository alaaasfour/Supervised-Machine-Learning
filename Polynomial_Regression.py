In this script, we will explore feature engineering and Polynomial Regression which allows us to use the machinery of
linear regression to fit very complicated, even very non-linear functions.

Polynomial Features
Let's try using what we know so far to fit a non-linear curve. We'll start with a simple quadratic:  y = 1+x^2

plt.plot(x, X@model_w + model_b, label = 'Predicted Value'); plt.xlabel("X"); plt.ylabel("y"); plt.legend(); plt.show()

"""
From the figure, we can notice that, it's not a great fit. What is needed is something like a second degree equation, or a polynomial feature. 
To accomplish this, we can modify the input data to engineer the needed features. 
If you swap the original data with a version that squares the ùë• value, then we can achieve what we need.

"""
From the figure, we can notice that, it's near perfect. We can also notice the values of w and b printed right above the graph: w,b 
found by gradient descent: w: [1.], b: 0.0490. 
Gradient descent modified our initial values of w,b to be (1.0,0.049), very close to our target of y = 1 x^2 + 1 . 
If we ran it longer, it could be a better match.
